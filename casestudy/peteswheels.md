projectTitle: E-Commerce Website
situation: Client had a marketing website that required a custom E-Commerce website to walk customers through a workflow as they build cusotm bicycle wheels. The client was originally working with several distributed teams on a wordpress website but were not meeting the client's feature expectations. <br />The client wanted a way to incorporate their custom app into their existing website using a CMS.
solution: Created E-Commerce module that plugged into the CMS so the client can still use their webpage and add any content they want. 
result: Client now spends more time focusing on their business of building wheels instead of generating quotes and sales for customers.
